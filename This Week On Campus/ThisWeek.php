                <h3>Walter L. Gross Jr. Family Student Athlete Development Center, Room 9b<br>4:00 - 5:00 PM</h3>
		<p>Campus Care is an opportunity for students to consult with a trained mental health professional in a less formal and more convenient setting than a counseling appointment.  Campus Care is a "drop-in" service. No appointment is necessary and there is no fee.  Students are seen on a first-come, first-served basis. Usually, there is not much of a wait and conversations are typically about 15 minutes long or less. Stop by if you have a mental health question!</p>

                <p>Come pet a therapy dog, twice a week!  Every Monday from 2:00-3:00 pm and every Thursday 3:00-4:00pm, stop by the Student Counseling Service to pet a certified therapy dog (or two!).
